    This repo contains software for ETL pipelines and research tools for the Neuropsychology and Aging Laboratory. The EMMA study is a research program being conducted by Dr. Schmitter-Edgecombe at Washington State University. This project is funded by the Department of Defense and has been reviewed and approved by the Washington State University Institutional Review Board. In this repo,
    you will find software used in the EMMA data-wrangling procedures, research querying tools, and the dashboard UI which is a web-based application.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The GSUR program is to explore the links between such diverse and yet complementary disciplines of computer science, electrical engineering, nursing, sociology, medicine and clinical psychology.
The neuropsychology and aging laboratory uses this code to compile and transform raw data from the EMMA project. It uses JSON to define complicated variables that researchers wish to
extract from the EMMA application. The data-wrangling software can automatically extract, transform, and load incoming data into mySQL databases. Researchers can further query the data through a specialized
querying application to interact with weekly calculation tables. The EMMA Dashboard is also available as a web-based UI to provide a snapshot of how participants are progressing through the study.
